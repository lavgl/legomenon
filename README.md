# legomenon

Legomenon is my helper in learning English.

It can give you a list of unknown words from the book sorted by frequency. It does that by parsing books, extracting words, counting them, and subtracting what you already know.

Legomenon is focused on answering the question: "What word should I learn next to improve my English reading experience?".

My current workflow:
1. Choose the book I'd like to read next or take what I'm already reading.
2. Upload it to Legomenon to get the list of book words minus the list of words you marked as known.
3. Work through the new list, mark words I know, and process unknown ones.
4. To process means to add an Anki card for it, including a meaning, an image, and a usage example.
5. Retain the word in long-time memory with Anki.


What I'm not trying to do:
- To build a new reader (I wanted once) or a new spaced repetition system.
- To automate an Anki card creation:
  - the quality of my hand-crafted cards is incompatibly higher than what I'm able to get programmatically;
  - the act of hand-crafting Anki cards is an act of understanding, and you can't remember what you don't understand (at leas it doesn't make sense);
  - I was trying to use shared Anki decks after hand-crafting my own, but it turned out to be unsatisfying
